### Data Structure Enhancements

#### Enhanced Workflow Structure
```javascript
{
  id: string,
  contentId: string,
  type: 'serial' | 'parallel' | 'hybrid',
  status: 'pending' | 'in-progress' | 'completed' | 'rejected' | 'cancelled',
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical',
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date,
  deadline: Date,
  estimatedCompletion: Date,
  steps: [
    {
      id: string,
      name: string,
      type: 'approval' | 'review' | 'notification',
      status: 'pending' | 'in-progress' | 'completed' | 'skipped' | 'rejected',
      assignedTo: string[],
      startedAt: Date,
      completedAt: Date,
      deadline: Date,
      order: number,
      dependencies: string[], // step IDs
      actions: [
        {
          id: string,
          type: 'approve' | 'reject' | 'request-changes' | 'comment',
          performedBy: string,
          timestamp: Date,
          comment: string,
          attachments: string[],
          metadata: object
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  analytics: {
    totalDuration: number,
    averageStepDuration: number,
    bottlenecks: string[],
    efficiency: number,
    slaCompliance: boolean
  }
}
```

#### Approval Action Structure
```javascript
{
  id: string,
  workflowId: string,
  stepId: string,
  contentId: string,
  type: 'approve' | 'reject' | 'request-changes' | 'comment' | 'escalate',
  status: 'pending' | 'completed' | 'cancelled',
  performedBy: {
    id: string,
    name: string,
    role: string,
    department: string
  },
  timestamp: Date,
  deadline: Date,
  comment: string,
  attachments: [
    {
      id: string,
      name: string,
      type: string,
      url: string,
      size: number
    }
  ],
  changes: [
    {
      field: string,
      oldValue: any,
      newValue: any,
      reason: string
    }
  ],
  metadata: {
    ipAddress: string,
    userAgent: string,
    location: string,
    duration: number
  }
}
```

### Real-time Update System

#### WebSocket Integration
```javascript
class WorkflowRealtimeManager {
  constructor() {
    this.socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080/workflow-updates');
    this.subscribers = new Map();
    this.initializeSocket();
  }
  
  subscribeToWorkflow(workflowId, callback) {
    if (!this.subscribers.has(workflowId)) {
      this.subscribers.set(workflowId, []);
    }
    this.subscribers.get(workflowId).push(callback);
    
    // Send subscription message
    this.socket.send(JSON.stringify({
      type: 'subscribe',
      workflowId: workflowId
    }));
  }
  
  handleWorkflowUpdate(update) {
    const { workflowId, type, data } = update;
    const callbacks = this.subscribers.get(workflowId) || [];
    
    callbacks.forEach(callback => {
      callback({ type, data });
    });
    
    // Update UI components
    this.updateWorkflowUI(workflowId, update);
  }
  
  updateWorkflowUI(workflowId, update) {
    // Update progress indicators
    // Refresh approval status
    // Show notifications
    // Update analytics
  }
}
```

### Workflow Analytics Engine

#### Performance Metrics Calculator
```javascript
class WorkflowAnalytics {
  calculateMetrics(workflows) {
    return {
      averageCycleTime: this.calculateAverageCycleTime(workflows),
      approvalRates: this.calculateApprovalRates(workflows),
      bottlenecks: this.identifyBottlenecks(workflows),
      efficiency: this.calculateEfficiency(workflows),
      slaCompliance: this.calculateSLACompliance(workflows),
      trends: this.analyzeTrends(workflows)
    };
  }
  
  identifyBottlenecks(workflows) {
    const stepDurations = new Map();
    
    workflows.forEach(workflow => {
      workflow.steps.forEach(step => {
        const duration = step.completedAt - step.startedAt;
        const key = `${step.name}-${step.type}`;
        
        if (!stepDurations.has(key)) {
          stepDurations.set(key, []);
        }
        stepDurations.get(key).push(duration);
      });
    });
    
    // Identify steps with longest average duration
    return Array.from(stepDurations.entries())
      .map(([step, durations]) => ({
        step,
        averageDuration: durations.reduce((a, b) => a + b) / durations.length,
        count: durations.length
      }))
      .sort((a, b) => b.averageDuration - a.averageDuration)
      .slice(0, 5);
  }
  
  predictCompletionTime(workflow) {
    // Machine learning model for completion time prediction
    // Based on historical data and current progress
  }
}
```

- **Completed**: All approvals obtained, content published
- **Rejected**: Content rejected by approver
- **Cancelled**: Workflow cancelled by author/admin
- **On Hold**: Temporarily paused workflow
- **Escalated**: Moved to higher authority due to delays

### Step Status Definitions
- **Pending**: Waiting for previous step completion
- **In Progress**: Currently being reviewed
- **Completed**: Step successfully completed
- **Skipped**: Step bypassed due to conditions
- **Rejected**: Step rejected, workflow stopped
- **Overdue**: Step past deadline
