- Bali-songs / balisong / batangas / butterfly knives (see exceptions)

#### Switchblades

Switchblades, also known as "automatic knives," open automatically with the push of a button. All automatic knives are prohibited, including automatic knives that are disabled or broken.

- Knives referred to as "dual" or "double action" and DMF or "dual multi-function" knives. These knives have a thumb stud, but they also have an automatic release which makes the item a switchblade.

- Camillus mc-1, a known paratrooper knife
- Automatic ice picks
- Out-the-front or OTF knives
- Harley Davidson switchblade
- Push daggers

### Module 5.3: Exception Examples

#### General Guidance

- **Toy (PVC/plastic) knives** and toy (PVC/plastic) hidden knives
- **Cold Steel** is a knife manufacturer. The Pocket Shark pen is fine to list as long as the item is not a hidden knife (it is generally used like a kubotan)
- **The Cold Steel Paradox Knife** is designed to look like a balisong or butterfly knife, but it cannot be opened with one hand
- **Elephant toenail knives** are generally okay to list because they are not actually made from elephant body parts. If the listing indicates that the item is made with ivory, bone, or other prohibited material, then it must comply with the Animal products policy

#### Hidden Knives

- Knife listings where the seller indicates the knife can be concealed, but it is not "disguised" as anything other than a knife
- Necklace knives with small (1 inch or less) blades
- If a knife is shaped like another item but clearly recognizable as a knife, then it should not be ended
- Key knives
- Credit card knives
- Bullet and shotgun shell knives
- Motorcycle-shaped knives
- Challenge coin knives
- Gerber Money Clip knives
- Utility knives such as Leatherman knives
- Tools often listed as "survival tools" or trekking poles that store a knife in the handle can be treated as a multi-tool and not as a hidden knife
- Bamboo swords / katana (stick swords) are not hidden knives
- A kubaton that is hiding a knife should be reviewed under the Weapons policy
- Flintlock daggers can be removed for the Replica Firearms policy if the item does not display proper replica markings

#### Switchblades

- Some sellers may refer to certain types of knives as "paratrooper knives" that are not gravity assisted or spring lever opened. These items would be permitted and are typically manually opened
- Parts for switchblade knives
- "Practice" balisong/butterfly knives must have holes in the blade large enough to prevent the knife from being sharpened on the edges and come to a dull point
- Wooden butterfly knives where the blade is made from wood
- Switchblade combs can be sold, as long as the seller doesn't mention or make reference to the comb being switched out for an actual knife blade
- Balisong knives should not be removed on name alone, as some knives are not butterfly knives, but are referred to as "balisong"
- Oversize balisong knives (requiring 2 hands to open) must be demonstrated in pictures
- Spring-assist knives, only when manual movement of the blade is required (moving the blade via a thumb stud, thumb hole, thumb disk, thumb screw, a lever that is part of the blade itself, etc.) to activate the spring (It is technically not an auto knife and would not be prohibited under our current switchblade guidelines.) End listings with shipping to AU, EU, or worldwide
- Spring-assist knives are allowed if the thumb screw, etc., is clearly visible in the listing image and is located on the blade itself
- Do not end "stilettos" on brand alone because not all stilettos are automatic knives. Stiletto knives that open manually are allowed
- "Switchblade" arrow heads
- Kershaw Ripcord 3200 belt clip knife is advertised as using OTF technology, but it is not an automatic knife

#### Push Daggers

- Katar swords
- Skinning knives aren't push daggers, even though they have the T-shaped handle. The design of the blade has a distinct grove in the end for cleaning a game animal

#### Special Shipping

- Throwing knives can only be sold domestically within the United States or Canada
- With regard to shipping knives to the UK/IE, there are some cutlery knives that are permitted:
  - Cheese knives
  - Butter knives
  - Fish knives
  - Steak knives

*Note: It is important to remember that Item Visibility Framework (IVF) may still block such listings, but, per the UK policy, these items can be offered on eBay.uk.*
